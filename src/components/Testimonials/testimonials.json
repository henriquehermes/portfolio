			"message": "I had the pleasure of working as team lead for Henrique at Wevolt, where he was a senior frontend developer (for quite some time, the only senior frontend developer).\n\nHe brings to the table deep knowledge of contemporary web app development and mobile app development and is very experienced with React / NextJS and React Native.\n\nHe communicates well and he works quickly and autonomously, quickly delivering anything from the realization of a complex design through to complex component logic. He never misses an opportunity to teach and to mentor with junior members of the team.\n\nI'd welcome the opportunity to work with Henrique again and I'd highly recommend him to anybody looking for a strong but flexible senior frontend developer."
